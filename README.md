## Labs
### Active Directory Lab
In this lab, I utilized VMware Workstation Pro to simulate an Active Directory environment. I learned to create and configure a Domain Controller within a specified domain in our mock network. Additionally, I set up a NAT scope to separate internal and external networks and created a DHCP scope for "user" devices. The lab included a Windows 10 client acting as a user and a Windows Server 2019 machine serving as our Domain Controller.
